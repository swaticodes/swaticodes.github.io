  <h3> Colorless </h3>
<div>when did everything get so bland
the grass a little duller
the sky a little gray-er
</div>

<div>
the faces blend together
all one and the same
</div>

<div>
walls turn into street corners
alleys to dead ends
</div>

<div>
darkness surrounds me enclosing the empty space
light threatens to break in
</div>

<div>
as I gaze at the sea of life
all I see is the lackluster remnants of yesterday
</div>

<div>
when did the world become so
c o l o r l e s s
</div>
