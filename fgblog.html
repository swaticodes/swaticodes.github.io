    Spring, spring, springing into spring!- 6/10/18 </h3></center>
<body>
  Spring. Spring cleaning. Spring break. Fresh. Clean. New. Something about spring is that it's a necessary part of the cycle of life. Where winter is cold and beauty is found in its icy exterior, spring is inviting and bright, beauty is found in its new beginnings. Spring is a new opportunity, it's a chance to start over. While winter undoubtedly is my favorite season, spring holds a special place in my heart because I'm a big believer in second chances. I like starting over with a clean slate. Spring is the end of an era and the start of a new one, an empty notebook. When New Year's Resolutions start to take their rightful places in the grave, spring offers them a chance at resurrection. Spring is inspiring, every year around the same time, I always find myself motivated to try something new. Whether it be learning a new language, starting a new healthy habit, the feeling of spring is always refreshing. Spring is like waking up on Sunday morning and making brunch for some well-deserved me time. It's realizing that nature was always there and it was you who missed its beauty in the first place. Spring is realizing that life has restarted after a stagnant winter. It's the jump in your step, the clarity in your mind. Maybe the flowers will inspire you, maybe the sun's rays bring you joy. But one thing's for sure, spring is the wake-up call we all need to kickstart the rest of our year.

Yes, I know, we are well into summer at this point, but I started this piece a while ago and I couldn't leave it unfinished! So, I hope you all look at spring a little differently now. Maybe it's not all allergies, coughing, and sneezing? After all, the bees are out here doing work, too!</body>
