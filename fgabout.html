  You may say I'm a dreamer, you'd be right

  Writer. Foodie. Bookworm. Overachiever. Thinker. This sixteen-year old likes to think she has it all together. She's wrong. But it's okay to be wrong every once in a while. She spends her days and nights, restless, wondering where to express her endless thoughts. Fragmented sentence are incomplete ideas, just like the ones in her mind. Join her as she over-dramatizes the life of a teenager in the 21st century, and learns some new things along the way. A head full of thoughts never does anyone good unless there's a place to share it.

<p>And remember, it's always good to get your thoughts out. Even if they're all in fragmented sentences. </p>
