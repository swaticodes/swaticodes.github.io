<body><p>A lot of productive writing time today!
I have updated 3 brand new poems on my 'Poetry' page including Words I'm Not Meant to Hear, Light and Dark, and Sun Rays.
Please go check them out as they are very close to my heart and will hopefully get you thinking!
I've also updated a late thought about Spring on the 'Blog/Thoughts' page, that I started a while ago and just got to finish.
As always, I hope you enjoy and please let me know what you think!
</p></body>
